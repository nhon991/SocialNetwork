                        We use cookies if you have a Banana account, use the Banana Products, including our website and apps, or visit other websites and apps that use the Banana Products (including the Like button or other Banana Technologies). Cookies enable Banana to offer the Banana Products to you and to understand the information we receive about you, including information about your use of other websites and apps, whether or not you are registered or logged in.

                        This policy explains how we use cookies and the choices you have. Except as otherwise stated in this policy, the Data Policy will apply to our processing of the data we collect via cookies.
                    </p>
                    <div class="tit">Why do we use cookies?</div>
                    <p class="det">
                        Cookies help us provide, protect and improve the Banana Products, such as by personalizing content, tailoring and measuring ads, and providing a safer experience. While the cookies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update the Banana Products, we use them for the following purposes:
                    </p>
                    <div class="de">Authentication</div>
                    <p class="det">
                        We use cookies to verify your account and determine when you’re logged in so we can make it easier for you to access the Banana Products and show you the appropriate experience and features.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        For example: We use cookies to keep you logged in as you navigate between Banana pages. Cookies also help us remember your browser so you do not have to keep logging into Banana and so you can more easily log into Banana via third-party apps and websites.
                    </p>
                    <div class="de">Security, site and product integrity</div>
                    <p class="det">
                        We use cookies to help us keep your account, data and the Banana Products safe and secure.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        For example: Cookies can help us identify and impose additional security measures when someone may be attempting to access a Banana account without authorization, for instance, by rapidly guessing different passwords. We also use cookies to store information that allows us to recover your account in the event you’ve forgotten your password or to require additional authentication if you tell us your account has been hacked.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        We also use cookies to combat activity that violates our policies or otherwise degrades our ability to provide the Banana Products.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        For example: Cookies help us fight spam and phishing attacks by enabling us to identify computers that are used to create large numbers of fake Banana accounts. We also use cookies to detect computers infected with malware and to take steps to prevent them from causing further harm. Cookies also help us prevent underage people from registering for Banana accounts.

                        We use cookies to help us show ads and to make recommendations for businesses and other organizations to people who may be interested in the products, services or causes they promote.

                    <p class="det">
                        For example: Cookies allow us to help deliver ads to people who have previously visited a business’s website, purchased its products or used its apps and to recommend products and services based on that activity. Cookies also allow us to limit the number of times that you see an ad so you don’t see the same ad over and over again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        We also use cookies to help measure the performance of ad campaigns for businesses that use the Banana Products.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        For example: We use cookies to count the number of times an ad is shown and to calculate the cost of those ads. We also use cookies to measure how often people do things like click on or view ads.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        Cookies help us serve and measure ads across different browsers and devices used by the same person.

                    <p class="det">
                            For example: We can use cookies to prevent you from seeing the same ad over and over again across the different devices that you use.

                    <p class="det">
                        Cookies also allow us to provide insights about the people who use the Banana Products, as well as, the people who interact with the ads, websites, and apps of our advertisers and the businesses that use the Banana Products.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        For example: We use cookies to help businesses understand the kinds of people who like their Banana page or use their apps so they can provide more relevant content and develop features that are likely to be interesting to their customers.
                    </p>
                    <p class="det">
                        We also use cookies to help you opt out of seeing ads from Banana based on your activity on third-party websites. Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off the Banana Products, and the controls available to you.
